# pelican-website

A pelican theme geared towards a website rather than just a blog.

Based quite heavily off of pelican-bootstrap3, I've added a few extra bits of config to account for the fact that this is meant for a whole site, of which the blog is just a part.

The pelican-bootstrap3 theme is quite elabourate.  I actually ended up removing a few features since I had no need of them.
